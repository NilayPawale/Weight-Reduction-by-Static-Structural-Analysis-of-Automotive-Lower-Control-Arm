The control arm is a unique type of independent suspension used in automobile vehicles. 
During the actual working condition, the maximum load is transferred from upper arm to 
the A arm which creates possibility of failure in the arm. Hence it is essential to focus on 
the stress analysis of A control arm to improve and modify the existing design. A control 
arm is an important part used in a suspension system of a car. control arm performance a 
major role in managing the motion of the wheel during bump, turning, and breaking. This 
paper proposed the design optimization and model analysis of steel cast for the front A 
control arm was investigated. CATIA software was utilized to design the A control arm. 
ANSYS 19 software was also used to analyze the structural strength and optimize the parts 
weight. The target of the new design was a 20% weight reduction from the existing part 
fabricated using steel material. Testing and validation of new design using FFT analysis. 
Model analysis carried out to find out natural frequencies of A control arm and validation 
are done with the help of FFT analyzer and Impact Hammer Test. 

The lower control arm gets more attention by many researches like study dynamic analyses 
of the motor vehicle suspension system using the point-joint coordinate’s formulation. The 
mechanical system is replaced by an equivalent constrained system of particles and then 
the laws of particle dynamics are used to derive the equations of motion. Modelling and 
simulation are indispensable when dealing with complex engineering systems. It makes it 
possible to do an essential assessment before systems are developed. It can provide support 
in all stages of a project from conceptual design, through commissioning and operation. 
The most effective was to improve product quality and reliability is to integrate them in 
the design and manufacturing process. 

Significance of Project 

The suspension system caries the vehicle body and transmit all forces between the body 
and the road without transmitting to the driver and passengers. The suspension system of a 
car is used to support its weight during varying road conditions. The suspension system is 
made of several parts and components. These include the front and rear. The suspension 
arm gets more attention by many researches like study dynamic analyses of the motor 
vehicle suspension system using the point-joint coordinate’s formulation. Modeling and 
simulation are indispensable when dealing with complex engineering systems. It can 
provide support in all stages of a project from conceptual design, through commissioning 
and operation. The most effective way to improve product quality and reliability is to 
integrate them in the design and manufacturing process.

The existing design has been modified, by reducing the thickness of the existing profile. 
The optimization of lower control arm is done by applying the Design of Experiments 
method. The parameters are identified. The FEA is done on LCA and the buckling load 
has been compared with the existing component. The sheet metal thickness of the new 
design has been reduced from 3.6 mm to 3mm. For the mass production the cost has been 
reduced to Rs.34000 for 2000 products in a batch as assumed. For the modified design 
the structural rigidity has been increased for the LCA, when compared to the existing 
design. Finally, mass of the control arm has been reduced up to 6.07 % when compared 
with existing model.
